I would like to thank everyone that in some way helped me and/or motivated me to improve this code.
In particular, I thank:
- CARLOS ALBERTO VAZ DE MORAIS JUNIOR, for tips regarding the creation of Fortran Libraries.
- FELIX HUBER, for pointing out an error in one of the partial trace subroutines and for 
               helpful suggestions and questions, and also for implementing the Python Wrappers
               of some of the subroutines provided in LibForQ.
- PRANAY BARKATAKI, whose questions helped to improve the general subroutine for partial traces.
