I would like to thank everyone that in some way helped or motivated me to improve this code.
In particular, I thank:

- CARLOS ALBERTO VAZ DE MORAIS JUNIOR, for tips regarding the creation of Fortran Libraries.
- FELIX HUBER, for pointing out an error in one of the partial traces subroutines and for several 
               helpful suggestions and questions.
